# Git is love, Git is life

All of this was created and tested with the help of excellent `Vagrant` project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bound1ess/love-git.git && cd love-git
./install.sh && ./test.sh
./vagrant.py # If you are curious ^_^
```

## What It Does

- Installs `git` package.
- Adds 5 handy aliases to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`, whatever).
- Helps you create an SSH key (if you do not have one) or enable the cache helper if you use HTTPS.
- Helps you configure an external diff viewer.
- Helps you add your email and name to the global Git config.
